# Azure Remote State Container module

Terraform module which creates remote state bucket that can be used as backend
for Terraform Azure provider.

These features are supported:

- region-specific bucket
- custom bucket naming
- specify versioning policy
- specify whether to force destroy or not
- apply custom bucket tags
- block public access to bucket

## Usage

```hcl
module "azurerm-remote-state" {
  source = "zenml-io/terraform-azurerm-remote-state"
  # We recommend pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  region      = var.region
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name

  tags = {
      env = "dev"
      managed-by = "terraform"
  }
}
```

Use this with an Azure provider and this will spin up a bucket you can use as a
remote state Terraform backend.
